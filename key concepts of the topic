ðŸŽ¯ Objective  
We are using Linear Regression to understand how one variable (Years of Experience) affects another variable (Salary). This is called Simple Linear Regression, since we have only one predictor.

ðŸ“Š 1. Linear Regression Table (Summary)  
This is a full statistical report that includes:

- Regression coefficients (intercept and slope)
- P-values (used for hypothesis testing)
- R-squared (explained variance)
- Standard Errors
- Confidence Intervals
- F-statistic (overall model fit)
- AIC/BIC (model quality metrics)

This is automatically generated by model.summary() in statsmodels.

---

ðŸ“Œ 2. Regression Info  
This includes general info about the regression like:

- Number of observations (how many data points)
- Degrees of freedom (related to number of predictors)
- AIC (Akaike Information Criterion): Lower is better.
- BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion): Lower is better.

These are useful to compare different regression models.

ðŸ”¢ 3. Regression Coefficients  
These are the values used in the regression equation:

Salary = Î²0 + Î²1 * YearsExperience

Where:

- Î²0 is the intercept (salary when experience = 0)
- Î²1 is the slope (how much salary increases with one more year of experience)

ðŸ“‰ 4. Regression P-Value  
This helps determine if the relationship between variables is statistically significant.

If the p-value is less than 0.05, it means the predictor has a significant impact on the target variable.

---

ðŸ“ˆ 5. Regression R-Squared  
R-squared tells how much of the variation in the target (Salary) is explained by the input (Years of Experience).

Ranges from 0 to 1:
- 0 = explains nothing
- 1 = explains everything

Also includes Adjusted R-squared which adjusts for the number of variables.
